I have watched the movie yesterday and I really enjoyed it. I wanted to share my thoughts about this period of
time and the ethical dilemmas it presents. In the recent time, I become more aware of the importance of privacy. Back in time to my third year in high school, I got a virus on my laptop that courpted my files and hackers left a `README.txt` file asking for ransom. I was lucky enough to have backups with my friends who helped me recover.

Now in 2025, I realized that hacking is not just about stealing data, or making stateless attacks. Now governments and corporations have the power of collecting trillions of real-time data points about individuals, making thousands of alternatives and more advanced `xkeyscore` programs. AI invasion and acceleration is mainly based on the free data recources that these companies are controlling, and all are legalized by the `Terms of use` agreements that we all accept without reading. AI Agents and hackers are simply doing the same but those are getting your permission to do so. I mean not all of them of course, but it's undeniable that these free agents are digesting your personal data in some way.

Articles like [this](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/09/privacy-matters-metas-generative-ai-features/) from Meta and other companies are trying to alleviate the concerns of users by providing some control over their data (no one can really check that is 100% true).

However, my problem with AI goes beyond data collection. And no I'm not concerned to be replaced (hopefully not soon at least). Ai was introduced in a very furios way, and people (including me) are still not completely aware of its implications, specifically career wise. For instance, Vibe coding is a catastorphe, especially for juniors and students. Anyway it's a different topic.

To sum up, I think our life is losing a lot of meanings and values as we advance, and I think we should all take a step, like Snowden one's, to at least protect our data and privacy. I don't think it will be that effictive tho, they are everywhere. Anyway enjoy the movie if you haven't watched it yet.
